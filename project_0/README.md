### What problem do we solve
Write programm to guess the number using minimal number of attempts 

**short info about data**
- computer choose a number between 1 and 100 and we need to write an algorithm which guess that number 
- algorithm uses the infomation about "more" or "less"

**KPI**
- The reults are estimated based on the average attepmts for 1000 repeats
